t| Ok! Tonight is the night!
t| My favorite band Musix is hosting tryouts for a new revovling member.
t| I've been practicing really hard and I know I can get in!
r| Get out of my way pipsqueak!
t| Hey! I'm up next, your cutting.
r| You realize you can't just play your baby piano. 
r| You need to be able to play all instruments, dance, and sing.
t| I know... and I can do all those things. Just watch.
r| If anyone is getting into Musix, its me, the raddest, badest, madest, man, RADD!
t| You still have to wait your turn....
t| I'll show you what I could do

t| Yea! I did it!
r| Don't get too excited, looks like we both made it to the next stage.
r| If I were you, I'd run home now since RADD is going to steal the show!
t| I'll see you at the next event then.
