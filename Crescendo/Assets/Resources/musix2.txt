t I've been practicing really hard and I know I can get in!|
r Get out of my way pipsqueak!|
t Hey! I'm up next, you're cutting.|
r You realize you can't just play your baby piano. |
r You need to be able to play all instruments, dance, and sing.|
t I know... and I can do all those things. Just watch.|
r If anyone is getting into Musix, its me, the raddest, baddest, maddest, man, RADD!|
t You still have to wait your turn....|
